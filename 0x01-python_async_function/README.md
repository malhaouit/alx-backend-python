# Python - Async

## About me
Hello! I'm a recent graduate from [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/), a school that offers comprehensive software engineering programs. Through my education at ALX Africa, I've gained substantial knowledge and hands-on experience in various aspects of software development.

Please note that I am not permitted to share specific **resources**, **tasks detail**, **examples**, or **proprietary information** from ALX Africa. However, I am excited to share my personal projects and the solutions I've developed. While this summary may not cover every detail, it should provide you with a solid understanding of my work and the code I've written. I encourage you to explore, learn, and use these resources freely.

## Introduction

## Mandatory tasks

### Task 0: The basics of async

Write an asynchronous coroutine `wait_random`.  
[File](0-basic_async_syntax.py)

### Task 1: Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async

Import `wait_random` from the previous python file and write an async routine called `wait_n` that takes in 2 int arguments.
