# Python - Async Comprehension

Hello! I'm a recent graduate from [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/), a school that offers comprehensive software engineering programs. Through my education at ALX Africa, I've gained substantial knowledge and hands-on experience in various aspects of software development.

I am excited to share my personal projects and the solutions I've developed. While this summary may not cover every detail, it should provide you with a solid understanding of my work and the code I've written.

# Introduction

The "Python - Async Comprehension" project is a backend development project focusing on enhancing understanding and skills in asynchronous programming using Python. This project, part of the ALX Backend Python curriculum, specifically targets the use of asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python.  

**Some of the project requirements:**  
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All modules and functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated

## Tasks

### Task 0: Async Generator

Write a coroutine called `async_generator` that takes no arguments.  
[File](0-async_generator.py)

### Task 1: Async Comprehensions

Import `async_generator` from the previous task and then Write a coroutine called `async_comprehension`.  
[File](1-async_comprehension.py)  

### Task 2: Run time for four parallel comprehensions

Import `async_comprehension` from the previous file and write a `measure_runtime` coroutine.
[File](2-measure_runtime.py)
